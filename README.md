🥛 DairyGuard – Smart Milk Freshness Detection System
DairyGuard is an innovative AI + IoT-based system designed to detect milk freshness and predict spoilage time using optical sensors and machine learning.This project addresses real-world challenges in the dairy industry by enabling smarter quality control and reducing milk wastage.

🚀 Features
🔍 Freshness Classification: Distinguishes between fresh and spoiled milk using optical properties.

📈 Spoilage Prediction: Estimates how long the milk will remain fresh.

🧠 ML-Powered Analysis: Uses machine learning algorithms trained on optical data for accurate detection.

🌐 IoT Integration: Real-time data collection via sensors and microcontrollers.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Hardware:

Optical Sensor

NodeMCU ESP8266

Software:

Python (Machine Learning)

Streamlit(for frontend dashboard)

ML Frameworks:

Scikit-learn /

Pandas for analysis

🧪 How It Works
Data Collection: Optical sensors measure specific light wavelengths reflected from the milk sample.

Data Processing: The data is sent via the IoT module to a backend server.

ML Inference: The machine learning model classifies milk as fresh or spoiled and predicts remaining shelf life.

Output: Results are displayed on the frontend dashboard.
